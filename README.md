# PyBer_Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the PyBer ride sharing data to gain an understanding of ridership and fare matrics by the types of the cities where PyBer operates. Create visualations of the rideshare data for PyBer to improve accesss to ridesharing services and to look at affordability for neighborhoods not using services.

## Results:

### The following Chart has the Summary and Statistical Overview of the PyBer Data

After reviewing the findings from the analysis there are a few key ones.

  - Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while Rural has the lowest.
  - Urban cities have more drivers than Suburban and Rural cities combined.
  - Suburban cities have 412 more drivers than in Rural but around 4 times the revenue.
  - Rural has the highest average fare per driver and ride.
  - Urban cities have a higher ratio of drivers to rides than the others and have a higher revenue.

## Summary:

Based on the Analysis I recommend PyBer to increase the number of drivers in the Rural areas so there are enough to meet ride demand. Rural rides could be longer distances based on the average fares per ride and average fares per driver. Where the drivers could have longer ride times and in that time more fares can come but lack of drivers could affect future revenue. Another thing to look into is the amount of drivers for the Urban areas, there are nearly twice the amount of drivers compared to the amount of rides. Which means drivers could be missing chances to work due to lack of work in which having some go to Rural areas could end up benefitting Rural areas and Urban drivers.
